# PythonOllamaAIFiles
This is the files for my python Ollama AI thing.

Method1.py uUes the python ollama library and doesn't seem to work with multithreading

Method2.py Is my method and uses cURL to make a request directly to the local AI server and works with multithreading

I have no idea what I am doing so my code will probably be written in the worst way possible.
